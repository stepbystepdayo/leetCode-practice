Given a linked list of integers, remove any nodes from the linked list that have values that have previously occurred in the linked list. Your function should return a reference to the head of the updated linked list.

Example:
Input: (3) -> (4) -> (3) -> (2) -> (6) -> (1) -> (2) -> (6) -> N
Output: (3) -> (4) -> (2) -> (6) -> (1) -> N
Explanation: The input list contains redundant nodes (3), (6), and (2), so those should be removed from the list.
