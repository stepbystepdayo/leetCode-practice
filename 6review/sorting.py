# first, we need to compare 1 and 3 then, 3 is bigger than 1 so stay there 
# second, need to compare 3 and 2 then, 2 is less than 3 so need to swap 2 and 3 => 1,2,3,4
# third, compare 1 and 2 then, 1 is less than 2. stay there
# compare 3 and 4 then, 3 is less than 4 


# Bubble Sort
# thinking style:
# 5,3,1,2,4

# first comprare 5 and 3 then, 5 is bigger than 3 so swap
# second, compare 5 and 1 then, 5 is bigger than 1 so swap => 3,1,5,2,4
# compare 5 and 2 then, 5 is bigger so swap => 3,1,2,5,4
# compare 5 and 4 then, 5 is bigger so swap => 3,1,2,4,5
# Third, we need to back to first number that mean 3!!
# then, compare 3 and 1. 3 is bigger so swap => 1,3,2,4,5
# compare 3 and 2. 3 is bigger so swap => 1,2,3,4,5
# compare 3 and 4. 4 is bigger than 3 so STOP this loop!! DONE
